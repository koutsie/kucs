# Kucs
Koutsies unnecessary complicated scripts.

This is the ultimateum of my shitty bash scripts.
This script/config/alias package consists of:
1. **lolcat**
2. **lolcat-c**
3. **screen**
4. **redshit
wich are also required to use Kucs.

File/Directory structure:
Scripts **should** be in: /home/user/scripts/
Configs **should** be in: /home/user/.config/kucs/
